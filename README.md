# tosinaa_dlmdspwp01
This is my project for the Programming with Python course at IU International University of Applied Science, Germany.

The project repository is made up of the following folders that need to be pulled together.
1.  develop
2.  implement
3.  test
4.  README.md

The develop folder contains the developed program module called olspwp used later for the data analysis in the jupyter notebook in the implement folder. The data analysis is done based on the use of different libraries.

The datasets created using the olspwp program have the characteristics of the pandas DataFrame. Hence, it is possible to use other methods and attributes taken from pandas module.
